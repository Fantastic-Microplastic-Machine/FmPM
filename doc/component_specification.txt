Component specification

Input:
----------------
Name: ParseArgs
What is does: Break down user command line arguements
Inputs: String
Outputs: List of strings






Pre-processing:
----------------
Name: LoadImage
What it does: loads the .bmp image into the working notebook
Inputs: .bmp microparticle image file 
Outputs: image representation of the .bmp file

Name: ResizeImage
What it does: resizes and crops any unnecessary borders of the .bmp file
Inputs: .bmp file from LoadImage 
Outputs: resized and cropped image file

Name: HistogramEqualizer
What it does: improve contrast of the image files
Inputs: resized and cropped image files from ResizeImage
Outputs: higher contrast image

Name: RemoveNoise
What it does: removes unwanted features or noise from the image (e.g. imperfections of the filter paper background)
Inputs: a microscopy image 
Outputs: a cleaned-up image that has spots/imperfections from the filter paper removed 





Feature Extraction:
-------------------
Name: FeatureExtraction (Likely needed to be broken down further)
What it does: identifies the important features of the data file (e.g. microparticle)
Inputs: an individual image
Outputs: output a numerical representation (matrix) representation of the image 

Name: Segmentation
What it does: understand the image by segmenting the image into a background and particle
Inputs: resized and cropped image file from ResizeImage
Outputs: segmentation map indicating background and particle portion on image

Name: DimensionExtractor
What it does: extracts or measures the maximum length of each particle segmentation
Inputs: segmentation map from Segmentation function (possibly labeled size for checking?)
Outputs: dimension of size in pixels that is then converted into microns





Training:
-------------------
Name: SaveModel
What it does: saves a model
Inputs: filename to save model as
Outputs: filepath and notification of successful save


Name: TrainShapeClassifier (supervised learning?) 
What it does: trains the ShapeClassification function
Inputs: accuracy of predicted labels from shape classifier
Outputs: a trained model 


Name: TrainColorClassifier
What it does: trains the ColorClassification function
Inputs: accuracy of predicted labels from color classifier
Outputs: a trained model 

Name: MicroparticleClassifier
What it does: trains the MicroparticleClassification function
Inputs: accuracy of predicted labels from color classifier
Outputs: a trained model 


Classifying:
-------------------
Name: ShapeClassifier (decision tree? k-means?) - May need to be machine learning
What it does: classifies the shape of the particle based on segmentation map
Inputs: labels of shape, segmentation map from Segmentation function
Outputs: classified shape as fiber, spherical, fragment, or irregular


Name: ColorClassifier
What it does: extracts the color of each particle
Inputs: resized and cropped image file
Outputs: color of the particle (RGB coordinates and color category)


Name: MicroplasticClassification
What it does: classifies the particle as micro plastic or non-mircroplastic
Inputs: dimension of size from DimensionExtractor, shape from ShapeClassifer, color from Color Extractor
Outputs: label of microplastic or non-microplastic
