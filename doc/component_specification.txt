Component specification

1. Name: LoadImage
What it does: loads the .bmp image into the working notebook
Inputs: .bmp microparticle image file 
Outputs: image representation of the .bmp file

2. Name: ResizeImage
What it does: resizes and crops any unnecessary borders of the .bmp file
Inputs: .bmp file from LoadImage 
Outputs: resized and cropped image file

3. HistogramEqualizer
What it does: improve contrast of the image files
Inputs: resized and cropped image files from ResizeImage
Outputs: higher contrast image 

4. Name: FeatureExtraction
What it does: identifies the important features of the data file (e.g. microparticle)
Inputs: 
Outputs:

6. Name: RemoveNoise
What it does: removes unwanted features or noise from the image (e.g. imperfections of the filter paper background)
Inputs: 
Outputs:

7. Name: Segmentation
What it does: understand the image by segmenting the image into a background and particle
Inputs: resized and cropped image file from ResizeImage
Outputs: segmentation map indicating background and particle portion on image

8. Name: DimensionExtractor
What it does: extracts or measures the maximum length of each particle segmentation
Inputs: segmentation map from Segmentation function
Outputs: size in pixels that is then converted into microns

7. Shape classification (decision tree? k-means?)

8. Color extractor

9. Train

10. Machine learning
