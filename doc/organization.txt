Rules for good coding practices for FmPM
1. Each have our own notebook/folder to work in
2. Main/master is always working and error free
3. Branches is where we'll work
4. We should all have our own branches
5. Merge to main when we're together meeting/resolved stuff together
-- Merge one branch at a time(?)
6. Create a folder for all our functions, utilities, files for utilities
-- Set the structure beforehand
