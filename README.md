# FmPM - Fantastic $\mu$Plastic Machine
FmPM is a Data Science Project that was developed by a group of graduate students from the University of Washington in Seattle.

# Project Overview
Microplastic pollution is an emerging global concern and there is an urgent need to understand the accumulation and transport of microplastics smaller than 1 mm. With the current rate of plastic consumption and the higher demands caused by the pandemic, it is urgent and critical to develop a computer vision and machine learning tool for quick and accurate analysis. In this project, we use chemically analyzed Raman microscopy images of microparticles to develop a model that can predict whether a particle is micro plastic or non-microplastic.
