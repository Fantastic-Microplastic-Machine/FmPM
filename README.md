# FmPM - Fantastic Î¼Plastic Machine
FmPM is a Data Science Project that was developed by a group of graduate students from the University of Washington in Seattle.

## Description
Microplastic pollution is an emerging global concern and there is an urgent need to understand the accumulation and transport of microplastics smaller than 1 mm. With the current rate of plastic consumption and the higher demands caused by the pandemic, it is urgent and critical to develop a computer vision and machine learning tool for quick and accurate analysis. One limitation in the field of microplastics is the ability to quickly and accurately categorize and label the large data sets of particles found in the environment. Currently, categorization and imaging are time-intensive and completed by human experts with ample experience in microplastic analysis. The understanding of physical features of microplastics can aid current computer vision programs in particle selection before chemical identification. With the application of machine learning techniques, it may be possible to identify specific features that are common in all microplastics and visually distinguish microplastics from non-microplastics. 

In this project, `FmPM` uses chemically analyzed and labeled Raman microscopy images of microparticles (microplastic and non-micropliastic particles) to develop a model that predicts whether a particle is microplastic or non-microplastic.
